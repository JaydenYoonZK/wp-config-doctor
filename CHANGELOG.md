## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-07

First stable release.

### Added

- Security and performance audit of a pasted wp-config.php, with findings ranked by severity and each carrying the exact line to fix it.
- Checks for security keys and salts (missing, placeholder, duplicate, short), debug exposure, empty or default database password, file editing lockdown, forced SSL admin, default table prefix, automatic updates, and performance constants.
- A 0 to 100 score as a rough hardening indicator.
- Fresh salt generator using the Web Crypto API, producing eight quote-safe 64-character keys.
- PHP-aware parser that correctly reads salts containing parentheses, quotes, and escapes.
- Dependency-free ES module engine (docs/config.js) with 10 Node tests.
- Browser UI in the shared suite design with light and dark themes and a ?demo deep link.
